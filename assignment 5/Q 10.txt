Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async and await?
Solution:
In JavaScript, you can define an asynchronous function using the `async` and `await` keywords.

The `async` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. An asynchronous function is a function that can return a promise. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the completion of a promise.

For example, the following code defines an asynchronous function that makes an asynchronous HTTP request and then prints the response:

```
async function myFunction() {
  const response = await fetch('https://www.example.com');
  console.log(response.text());
}
```

The `async` keyword is used to declare the `myFunction()` function as an asynchronous function. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the completion of the `fetch()` promise. The `fetch()` promise is resolved with the response from the HTTP request. The `console.log()` function then prints the response.

Here is the syntax for defining an asynchronous function in JavaScript:

```
async function functionName() {
  // Code that may make asynchronous calls.
}
```

The `functionName` can be any valid function name. The code inside the `async` function can make asynchronous calls using the `await` keyword. The `await` keyword will wait for the completion of the asynchronous call and then return the value of the promise.

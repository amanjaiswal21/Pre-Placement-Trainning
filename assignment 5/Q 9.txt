Q.9 Explain fetch.
Solution:
The fetch() method is a JavaScript method that allows you to make asynchronous HTTP requests. It is a newer alternative to the XMLHttpRequest object, and it is considered to be more modern and efficient.

The fetch() method takes a URL as its only argument, and it returns a promise. The promise is resolved with the response from the HTTP request, or rejected if the request fails.

The response from the HTTP request is a Response object. The Response object contains the status code, headers, and body of the response.

The fetch() method can be used to make any type of HTTP request, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

For example, the following code makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the Google homepage:

```
const response = await fetch('https://www.google.com');

if (response.ok) {
  console.log(response.text());
} else {
  console.log(response.statusText);
}
```

The `fetch()` method is a powerful tool that can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is a more modern and efficient alternative to the XMLHttpRequest object, and it is easy to use.

Here are some of the benefits of using the fetch() method:

* **It is more modern and efficient than the XMLHttpRequest object.**
* **It is easier to use than the XMLHttpRequest object.**
* **It can be used to make any type of HTTP request.**

Overall, the fetch() method is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the quality of your JavaScript code.

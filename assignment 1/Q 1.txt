Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?
Solution:
   <!DOCTYPE html> is not a HTML tag. It is document type declaration. USing this we declare the type of document.
The declaration tells the web browser which version of HTML to expect and how to interpret the code in the document.In this case, <!DOCTYPE html> is used to declare that the
document is using the latest version of HTML, which is HTML5. Using the correct <!DOCTYPE> declaration is important because it helps ensure that the web browser renders the
document correctly and follows the appropriate standards and rules of the chosen HTML version.

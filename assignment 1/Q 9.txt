Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?
Solution:
In HTML, there is a distinction between tags and attributes:

1. HTML Tag:
HTML tags are used to define the structure and presentation of content within an HTML document. Tags are written between angle brackets (`<>`). For example, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<a>` are all examples of HTML tags. Each tag has a specific purpose and defines different elements on a webpage.

2. HTML Attribute:
HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are applied within the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of an attribute name and a corresponding value. Attributes are used to configure various aspects of an element's behavior, appearance, or functionality.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

In the example above:
- `<a>` is the HTML tag, representing a hyperlink.
- `href` and `target` are attributes of the `<a>` tag.
- `href="https://www.example.com"` specifies the URL that the hyperlink points to.
- `target="_blank"` specifies that the hyperlink should open in a new browser tab or window.

Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML element. Some examples of global attributes are:

- `class`: Specifies one or more CSS classes to be applied to an element.
- `id`: Assigns a unique identifier to an element.
- `style`: Defines inline CSS styles for an element.
- `title`: Provides a title or tooltip text for an element.
- `data-*`: Allows custom data attributes to be added to elements for storing extra information.
- `aria-*`: Used for accessibility purposes to provide additional information to assistive technologies.

These global attributes can be applied to various HTML elements to modify their behavior, appearance, or accessibility.

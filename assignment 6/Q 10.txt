Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?
Solution:
The `super` keyword in JavaScript is used to access the methods and properties of the parent class. It is used in classes that inherit from other classes.

The `super` keyword can be used to call the methods of the parent class. For example, if a class `Child` inherits from a class `Parent`, the `Child` class can call the `greet()` method of the `Parent` class using the following code:

```
class Child extends Parent {
  greet() {
    super.greet();
  }
}
```

The `super` keyword can also be used to access the properties of the parent class. For example, if a class `Child` inherits from a class `Parent`, the `Child` class can access the `name` property of the `Parent` class using the following code:

```
class Child extends Parent {
  greet() {
    console.log(super.name);
  }
}
```

The `super` keyword is a powerful tool that can be used to access the methods and properties of the parent class. It is a valuable tool for working with inheritance in JavaScript.

Here are some of the benefits of using the `super` keyword:

* **Code reuse:** The `super` keyword can be used to reuse the code of the parent class. This can save time and effort in development.
* **Maintainability:** The `super` keyword can make code easier to maintain. This is because the code for the parent class is all in one place, so it is easy to find and modify.
* **Extensibility:** The `super` keyword can be used to extend the functionality of the parent class. This can be done by adding new methods or properties to the child class.

Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?
Solution:
The `this` keyword in Java refers to the current object. It can be used to access the object's data members and methods.

The `this` keyword can be used in constructors to initialize the object's data members. For example, the following code initializes the object's `name` data member to the value of the `name` parameter:

```java
public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
```

The `this` keyword can also be used to call the methods of the current object. For example, the following code calls the `greet()` method of the current object:

```java
public void greet() {
    System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}
```

The `this` keyword can be used anywhere in a method where the current object is needed. It is a very useful keyword that can make your code more concise and easier to read.

Here are some other uses of the `this` keyword:

* To distinguish between local variables and instance variables.
* To pass the current object as a parameter to a method.
* To invoke the constructors of the current class.

Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?
Solution:
A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods of an object, and it can be used to create multiple instances of the object.

Classes are created using the `class` keyword. The syntax for creating a class is as follows:

```
class MyClass {
  // Properties
  name = "John Doe";
  age = 30;

  // Methods
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `MyClass` class has two properties: `name` and `age`. It also has one method: `greet()`.

To create an instance of the `MyClass` class, you use the `new` keyword. The syntax for creating an instance of a class is as follows:

```
const myObject = new MyClass();
```

This will create a new object of the `MyClass` class, and the `myObject` variable will refer to the new object.

You can then access the properties and methods of the `myObject` object using the dot notation. For example, you can access the `name` property of the `myObject` object using the following code:

```
console.log(myObject.name); // "John Doe"
```

You can also call the `greet()` method of the `myObject` object using the following code:

```
myObject.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John Doe"
```

Classes are a powerful tool in JavaScript that can be used to create reusable and maintainable code. If you are new to JavaScript, it is a good idea to learn about classes early on.

Here are some of the benefits of using classes in JavaScript:

* **Reusability:** Classes can be used to create reusable code. This is because the code for a class can be used to create multiple instances of the class.
* **Maintainability:** Classes can make code easier to maintain. This is because the code for a class is all in one place, so it is easy to find and modify.
* **Abstraction:** Classes can be used to abstract the implementation details of an object. This makes the object easier to use, as the user does not need to know how the object works.
* **Encapsulation:** Classes can be used to encapsulate data and methods. This makes the data and methods of an object more secure, as they are hidden from the user.
